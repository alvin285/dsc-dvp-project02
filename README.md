FOOD SECURITY ANALYSIS IN UGANDA KARAMOJA(2017).

PROJECT OVERVIEW.

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda, experiencing persistent droughts, pest outbreaks and low agricultural productivity.Several NGOs operate in the region to supporrt farmers with technical assistance and farm inputs.Hoewever they lack a data-driven tool to monitor cropyields and food securioty trends across administrative levels.

This project  devel;ops an interactrive data visualisation dashboard to supportr food security monitorinhg for the 2017 season.The tool focusses on remotely measured yields of sorghum and maize using satellite-based data and administrative boundary shapefiles(district and sub-county level)
The dashboard serves as afirstr mock-up of a Food Security Monitoring Tool for decision-making by NGOs operating in Karamoja,.

BUSINESS PROPBLEM.
NGOs operating in Karamoja:
-Lack visibility into regional crop productivity patterns.
-Rely on localised or incomplete information.
-Struggle to prioritize interventions effectively.
-Cannot easily compare productivity across districts and sub-counties.
-Do not have a centralised visual tool combining yield,area,production and population data.
Without a structured monitoring tool, resource allocation may be inefficient and slow, especially in drought-prone and vulnerable regions.

PROJECT OBKECTIVES.


Data Understanding
I will be dealing with the following data:

Uganda Karamoja District Crop Yield
Uganda Karamoja Subcounty Crop Yield
Below is the data composition;

Yield and Population per Subcounty
