FOOD SECURITY ANALYSIS IN UGANDA KARAMOJA(2017).

PROJECT OVERVIEW.

Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda, experiencing persistent droughts, pest outbreaks and low agricultural productivity.Several NGOs operate in the region to supporrt farmers with technical assistance and farm inputs.Hoewever they lack a data-driven tool to monitor cropyields and food securioty trends across administrative levels.

This project  devel;ops an interactrive data visualisation dashboard to supportr food security monitorinhg for the 2017 season.The tool focusses on remotely measured yields of sorghum and maize using satellite-based data and administrative boundary shapefiles(district and sub-county level)
The dashboard serves as afirstr mock-up of a Food Security Monitoring Tool for decision-making by NGOs operating in Karamoja,.

BUSINESS PROPBLEM.

NGOs operating in Karamoja:
-Lack visibility into regional crop productivity patterns.

-Rely on localised or incomplete information.

-Struggle to prioritize interventions effectively.

-Cannot easily compare productivity across districts and sub-counties.

-Do not have a centralised visual tool combining yield,area,production and population data.

Without a structured monitoring tool, resource allocation may be inefficient and slow, especially in drought-prone and vulnerable regions.


PROJECT OBJECTIVES.

The main objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive dashboard that:

*Visualizes crop yields(kg/Ha) for sorghum and maize.

*Display total crop area and total production.

*Integrate population data to assess food security vulnerability.

*Allows analysis of both;
   -District level.
   -Sub-county level.
   
*include geographical map visualization for spatial analysis.

*Compare between sorghum and maize productivity.

KEY QUESTIONS.

-Which districts and subcounties have the lowest crop yields?

-How does crop yield vary across districts?

-Which district have a high population but low production?

-Which subcounty produce the most total food?

-Which subcounties contribute most to District production?

FINAL GOAL.

The final goal of this project is to provide NGOs with a data-driven decision support tool that:
-identifies areas with high crop yield.
-supports targeted food security interventions.
improves monitoring of agricultural productivity trends.




Data Understanding
I will be dealing with the following data:

Uganda Karamoja District Crop Yield
Uganda Karamoja Subcounty Crop Yield
Below is the data composition;

Yield and Population per Subcounty
